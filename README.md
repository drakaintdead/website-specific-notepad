# Website Specific Notepad

This chrome extension is designed to give you a notepad that changes for every website. Meaning you could be taking notes in amazon.com, and then go into bestbuy.com and take notes there. If you went back to amazon, the notes that you took in amazon saved, but you won't see the notes you took in bestbuy without going back to that page. These notes save if you close the tab, or quit chrome. Just go back to the same website and the notes will be waiting for you.

As the extension is still in development, it is not listed on the chrome web store. to use it, follow these steps:
> 1. Download the main branch of this repo.
>     - Make sure that all the files are in a singular folder
> 2. Open the chrome manage extensions page, by either clicking on the extensions icon and then clicking "Manage Extensions" or by going to <chrome://extensions>.
> 3. In the top right of the page, click the button to enable developer mode. This lets you load extensions that are not on the chrome web store.
> 4. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left of the page, and select the folder that contains all of the extensions files.
> 5. Now, the extension is added. You should see a new extension pop up, titled "Website Specific Notepad".

#### To do:
